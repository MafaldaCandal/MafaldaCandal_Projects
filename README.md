## Project Overview (Reverse chronology)

### 2025

- [Nand2Tetris](./Nand2Tetris)  
  Implementation of projects 1, 2 and 6 from Nand2Tetris course, including a basic assembler and low-level logic simulation.

- [Python_SimplificationTruthTables](./Python_SimplificationTruthTables)  
  This project simplifies Boolean functions and optimizes them using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs).
  The first part reduces truth tables using a merging strategy inspired by the Quine-McCluskey algorithm; the second part builds a more efficient BDD through heuristic variable reordering based on frequency and adjacency analysis.

- [AI_Ethics_Essays](./AI_Ethics_Essays)  
  A series of short essays on the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence, including bias, autonomy, and decision-making.

- [Pandas_DataAnalysis](./Pandas_DataAnalysis)  
  This project analyzes over 3.4 million NYC 311 service requests through data wrangling and exploratory analysis.
  Techniques include feature selection, datetime processing, aggregation, and visualization to uncover spatial and temporal complaint patterns.

### 2024

- [C_DataStructures_Projects](./C_DataStructures_Projects)  
  This folder includes six projects that explore data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, tries, heaps) and memory management in C.
  The projects include 1) Airport Simulation, 2) Doctor’s Office, 3) Spellchecker, 4) Train Routing, 5) Student Manager.

- [R_StatisticalAnalysis](./R_StatisticalAnalysis)
  This project analyzes Major League Baseball player salaries using linear regression model selection techniques, including best subset selection, forward selection, and repeated cross-validation to determine the optimal number of predictors based on adjusted R², BIC, and prediction error.

- [Python_TaskManager](./Python_TaskManager)  
  This was one of my inital programming projects.
  A desktop task manager built with Tkinter that allows users to add, update, and categorize tasks by urgency, track progress, revisit completed tasks, and select daily priorities through randomization — with data stored in a persistent JSON file.

- [QGIS_CaseStudies](./QGIS_CaseStudies)  
  This folder includes three case studies of spatial analysis and geoprocessing with QGIS.
  The projects include: 1) Flood Risk Assessemnt in Ijsselmonde, 2) Wind Farm Siting in Friesland, 3) Intersection of Nightlife, Buses, and Road Safety in Delaware
