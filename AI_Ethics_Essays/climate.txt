The growing environmental impact of AI calls for regulatory measures that help achieve balance between technological advancement and sustainability. Amongst the five policy proposals outlined in the paper shared (co-regulation, sustainability by design, restrictions on AI training, consumption caps, and a mixed approach), the most promising option for implementation is sustainability by design. This approach fights for including environmental considerations into AI development from the first stages of development, ensuring that sustainability is not an afterthought, but a guiding principle that shapes the industry's trajectory.
Sustainability by design is a natural and reliable option, as it builds on already existing regulatory frameworks, namely data protection by design under the GDPR. This precedent ensures that integrating compliance mechanisms directly into technological development is both achievable and enforceable. Still, a specific framework for AI development would require experts to conduct sustainability impact assessments (SIAs) to measure the environmental costs of model training, deployment, and use. By mandating the assessment of energy and water consumption, policymakers can push AI firms toward more efficient practices without hindering innovation. In fact, this method allows flexibility for companies to tailor their sustainability efforts based on their specific technological needs while adhering to overarching regulatory goals. Unlike strict consumption caps or outright restrictions, sustainability by design enables gradual adaptation to greener practices without immediate disruptions to AI advancements.
Despite its promise, several challenges must be addressed for sustainability by design to be effectively implemented. The first challenge relates to metrics, as existing sustainability metrics often focus only on AI training emissions, ignoring broader environmental factors such as hardware production, data storage, and deployment energy usage. The solution would come from an expert effort to create a more holistic life cycle framework, assessing AI’s impact from hardware manufacturing to disposal, ensuring a comprehensive sustainability approach. The second challenge alludes to the possible trade-offs between algorithmic efficiency and model performance. More complex models tend to be more accurate but also less sustainable, raising the concern that stricter sustainability requirements could hinder AI performance in fields like medicine, finance, and scientific research. This possible downside would be neutralized by the development of efficiency-first AI architectures, such as low-power neural networks, quantization techniques, and federated learning, that prioritize sustainability without sacrificing accuracy (also leading to further innovative and sustainable development). And the third, and possibly most predictable challenge is connected to enforcement and compliance, considering that sustainability by design does not rely on clear thresholds, but on firms self-regulating their practices. This could lead to varying levels of compliance, and therefore there is a clear need for implementing third-party audits and government oversight to verify the legitimacy of sustainability impact assessments would enhance accountability.
While other proposals offer viable solutions, I believe they face greater feasibility hurdles. Consumption caps based on societal importance introduce subjective judgments about which AI applications deserve higher energy allowances, making enforcement complex and contentious and also raise questions about the survival of smaller AI projects. Emissions trading for AI would require integrating AI emissions into existing carbon markets—a logistically challenging process with uncertain short-term benefits. Restrictions on AI training risk stifling innovation, as there hasn’t been time to develop alternative approaches, without guaranteeing proportional environmental gains. Meanwhile, co-regulation lacks binding enforcement, making it weaker as a standalone strategy. In contrast, sustainability by design provides a structured yet flexible approach, embedding environmental responsibility into AI development while allowing companies to innovate within clear regulatory guidelines. As a result, it offers the best balance between practical implementation, enforceability, and long-term industry sustainability.
