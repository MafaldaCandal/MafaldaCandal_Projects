New ethical concerns emerge as capitalism and globalisation shape the industries. A fundamental concept to introduce is neocolonialism, which refers to the control imposed on less-developed countries by developed nations through indirect means, particularly economic, financial, and trade mechanisms. The term encompasses a negative view on global power structures where corporations and institutions perpetuate colonial-style exploitation in developing countries (Halperin, 2023). A clear example of this dynamic in the modern tech industry can be found in the data labeling sector, particularly OpenAI’s use of Kenyan workers for less than $2 per hour to label harmful content and refine AI models. While OpenAI, a U.S.-based company, profited, Kenyan workers faced low wages and psychologically taxing conditions (Perrigo, 2023).
This case reflects key characteristics of neocolonialism. The first is the extraction of value from developing countries without fair compensation. Kenyan workers were essential in refining OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Despite their crucial role, these workers were paid extremely low wages and subjected to harsh, psychologically distressing conditions, even as OpenAI secured billions in investments from firms like Microsoft. The second characteristic is economic dependency. Kenya’s workforce was chosen for its low labor costs, lack of strong labor protections, and the economic vulnerability of workers who feared jeopardizing their families’ livelihood. The third characteristic is the unequal distribution of benefits. Contracts between OpenAI and Sama illustrate how the majority of profits flowed to the Global North, while Kenyan workers and their local economy saw minimal long-term gain. This imbalance reinforces a structural cycle of dependency, limiting economic development and technological self-sufficiency in the Global South.
Different approaches to data labeling reveal how the structure of the AI industry often reinforces neocolonial dynamics. Internal labeling, which offers the highest quality control, is typically limited to wealthier countries due to its high costs. In contrast, lower-cost alternatives (such as programmatic labeling, which automates annotation but still depends on human oversight, and crowdsourcing, which distributes tasks to large pools of low-paid workers) are more commonly outsourced to developing nations. Synthetic labeling, which uses artificially generated data, can reduce costs but often lacks the richness and diversity of real-world examples, making human labor in the Global South even more essential (IBM, 2021). Some of these methods are often chosen not (just) for efficiency, but because they allow companies to bypass stronger labor protections and minimize costs by relying on economically vulnerable populations. In the case of OpenAI, Kenyan workers were contracted through the outsourcing firm Sama under the banner of “ethical AI,” yet were paid minimal wages to process disturbing content under psychologically harmful conditions. While this exploitation fits within a neocolonial framework, it differs from traditional colonialism in that control is exercised contractually and economically rather than politically. Nonetheless, workers had limited choice, constrained by poverty and the need to support their families. Addressing these trends requires structural reforms: AI companies must provide fair compensation, mental health support, and transparency, while developing nations should invest in their own AI infrastructure to reduce dependency on foreign tech powers.


In conclusion, Kenyan data labelers’ experience highlights modern neocolonial exploitation in the tech industry. While AI firms benefit from outsourced labor, workers in developing nations endure low wages and harsh conditions, reinforcing economic inequalities. Addressing these issues requires systemic reforms prioritizing ethical labor practices and economic empowerment.
